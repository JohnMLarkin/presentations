* neutron = udd

[.degrade,transition="convex-in convex-out"]
=== Weak interaction transforms
* The primary effect of the weak interaction is to transform:
** proton to neutron
** neutron to proton
* Usually also involves creation or absorption of neutrinos

=== stem:[N \approx Z] because...
The Pauli exclusion principle and energy quantization imply that there can be a significant energy advantage to transforming excess neutrons to protons or excess protons to neutrons.

If a physical process that lowers a system's rest energy **can** take place, it eventually **will** take place.

[transition="convex-in convex-out", transition-speed=slow]
=== Interior binding term
This term accounts for the strong interaction between pairs of nucleons.

[stem]
++++
\begin{align*}
E_I & = \left(\mbox{number of nucleons}\right) \left( \frac{\mbox{bonds}}{\mbox{nucleon}}\right) \left( \frac{\mbox{energy}}{\mbox{bond}} \right) \\
  & = a_I A
\end{align*}
++++

[transition="convex-in convex-out",transition-speed=slow]
=== Surface correction term
Nucleons on the surface have fewer neighbors so too many bonds were included in the interior binding term. This is the correction factor.

[stem]
++++
\begin{align*}
E_S & = \left(\mbox{number of surface nucleons}\right) \left( \frac{\mbox{bond overcount}}{\mbox{surface nucleon}}\right) \left( \frac{\mbox{energy}}{\mbox{bond}} \right) \\
  & = a_S A^{2/3}
\end{align*}
++++

[transition="convex-in convex-out",transition-speed=slow]
=== Coulomb repulsion term
Every proton repels every other proton.

[stem]
++++
\begin{align*}
E_C & = \frac{1}{2} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{Z} \sum\limits_{\begin{array}{c}j=1\\j \ne i\end{array}}^Z \frac{ke^2}{r_{ij}} \\
  & = \left(\mbox{number of proton pairs}\right) \left( \frac{ke^2}{r_\mathrm{avg}} \right) \\
  & = \frac{1}{2} Z(Z-1) \left( \frac{ke^2}{r_\mathrm{avg}} \right) \\
  & = a_C Z^2 A^{-1/3}

The quantization of energy levels and the limitations imposed by the Pauli exclusion principle have not been included in the other terms. Here we account for the cost of having unequal numbers of protons and neutrons.

Neutrinos are associated with weak interactions.

The nucleus starts with 17 protons and 20 neutrons but if it absorbs a neutrino a neutron becomes a proton.

--

[.column]
.**Explanation**
--
The nucleus starts with 2 protons and 4 neutrons. It can become lower energy by transforming a neutron to a proton.

Charge must be conserved so an electron also results.

Transforming n to p requires the weak interaction and this results in some type of neutrino. The electron is normal matter so we need some anti.

[.column]
.**Explanation**
--
The original nucleus has 13 protons and 13 neutrons. It could move to either 12 protons and 14 neutrons **or** to 14 protons and 12 neutrons.

Protons have less mass but also repel each other. With this many protons, the repulsion is beginning to be more significant than the mass difference so it is better to have 12 protons.

.**Explanation**

Certain _magic number_ are more stable than would be expected from the semi-empirical binding energy formula. This is similar to filled orbitals for atoms.

A class in nuclear physics would get into more sophisticated models that include those effects.
